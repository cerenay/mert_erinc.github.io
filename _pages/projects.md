<strong>Work in Progress</strong>

**Information Avoidance in Reciprocal Decisions**

How the perception of what is right to do change by information? By investigating strategic ignorance and by comparing the effects of ex-ante and ex-post ignorance this project aims to answer following questions: Do people act pro-socially not to suffer from the action(letting others down or causing an unfair outcome) or do they compelled to do so in certain situations to protect their social /self image (to see themselves in the desired way)? Do they avoid observing the consequences of their choices in a rich moral context like reciprocal decisions? Results from the project shows that under exogenous ignorance, selfish behavior increases substantially and strategic ignorance is almost same both in ex-ante and ex-post situations. Which proposes that violations of existing mainstream models on fairness and inequality are driven by the desire to be seen in the desired way to oneself and to others.
